Tutorials
==================

At the moment we have two tutorials. First we have a simple tutorial that covers the basics of a conversion pipeline, 
provides a quick overview of the elements involved and shows some visualization with `nwb widgets <https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwb-jupyter-widgets>`_.

Then we have a second tutorial which describes in more detail each of the steps outlined previously.
