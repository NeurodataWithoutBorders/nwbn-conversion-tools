Part 5, NWB Converter Web UI
============================

Once the ``NWBConverter`` class for a given experiment is built, the NWB
Converter GUI provides a web user interface that communicates with the
``NWBConverter`` without any programming necessary. The source data,
conversion options, and metadata dictionary supplied by the ``NWBConverter``
are mapped to a form that can be filled out by a user and submitted to
the ``NWBConverter`` object for running the conversion.
