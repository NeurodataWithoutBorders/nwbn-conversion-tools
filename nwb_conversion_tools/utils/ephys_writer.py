    Writes one object to NWB.



    Parameters
    ----------
    object_to_write: object
        spike interface/extractors object
            Supported objects are:
            - spikeinterface version <= 0.13 extractors
              (spikeextractors.RecordingExtractor / spikeextractors.SortingExtractor)
            - spikeinterface version >= 0.90 objects
              (spikeinterface.RecordingExtractor / spikeinterface.SortingExtractor / spikeinterface.WaveformExtractor)
            - NEO >= 0.10 objects
              (neo.rawIO / neo.IO)
    nwb_file_path: str
        path to the nwbfile. if exists and overwrite is False, then it will append.
    nwbfile: pynwb.NWBFile
        existing nwbfile to append to.
    metadata: dict
    stub: bool
        whether to write a subset of recording
    kwargs:
        use_times (False): True then use timestamps array, else use starting time and rate for TimeSeries object
            in nwbfile
        write_as ("raw"): write the traces as raw or processed
        es_key (str): Key in metadata dictionary containing metadata info for the specific electrical series
        buffer_gb (float): If buffer_shape is not specified, it will be inferred as the smallest chunk below the
            buffer_gb threshold. Defaults to 1 GB.
        buffer_shape (tuple): Manually defined shape of the buffer. Defaults to None.
        chunk_mb (float): If chunk_shape is not specified, it will be inferred as the smallest chunk below the
            chunk_mb threshold. H5 reccomends setting this to around 1 MB (our default) for optimal performance.
        iterator_type ("v2"): v2 is using the custom datachunkiterator for chunking, v1 is using the built in
            datachunk iterator from hdf5
        chunk_shape (tuple): Manually defined shape of the chunks. Defaults to None.
        write_scaled (False): If True, writes the scaled traces (return_scaled=True)
        compression ("gzip"): Type of compression to use. Valid types are "gzip" and "lzf".
            Set to None to disable all compression.
        compression_opts (int): Only applies to compression="gzip". Controls the level of the GZIP.
        skip_unit_properties (list): names of unit properties to skip writing to nwbfile,
        skip_unit_features (list): names of unit features (old spikeextractors) to skip,
        skip_electrode_properties= (list): extractor's channel properties to skip,
        unit_property_descriptions(dict()): custom descriptions for the unit properties
            (units column in nwbfile) defaults to "no description"
        write_electrical_series (True): whether to store traces as electricalseries in nwb object.
        overwrite (True): whether to overwrite the nwbfile or not, only valid if the file path exists.
